# Lean Line

This exercise is designed to 

## Materials

* 

## Rules

* Everyone must touch each frog before it is done
* Two people may not be touching the same frog at the same time
* If a frog hits the floor, it hops away, and must start from the beginning
* Color rules (Start with only pink, adding more complexity as the group masters the complexity they are dealing with):
    * Pink frogs go through the group alphabetically by first name
    * Orange frogs go through the group by height (short to tall)
    * Green frogs go through the group by birthday (Jan 1 - Dec 31)
    * Ducks are top priority

Play progresses through iterations of 2 minutes of executing and 2 minutes of retrospective (both should be timed). Record how many frogs were completed and how long it took to complete the first frog on each iteration.

Plan for a minimum of three iterations but hope to complete 4 or five.
